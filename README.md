## üöÄ Getting Started: Your Step-by-Step Guide

Setting up a new environment often takes more time than expected, so let's break it down into manageable steps.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Accept the GitHub Classroom Assignment

Accept this homework assignment in GitHub Classroom. This will enable
you to clone your own repository.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Clone the Repository

Once the assignment is accepted, clone your new repository to your
local machine.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Project Setup

Follow the [official guide for setting up an existing Lean
project](https://leanprover-community.github.io/install/project.html)
to set up your development environment.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ Fetch Prebuilt Dependencies

Run the following command to fetch the pre-built `mathlib` files. This is significantly faster than building `mathlib` on your local machine:

```bash
lake exe cache get
```
